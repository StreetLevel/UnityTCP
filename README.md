# UnityTCP
A TCP interface for Unity

## A scientific visualization interface for Unity

This library provides a TCP-Interface for the transmission of 3d mesh-data between Julia and Unity. The Unity part of this interface cleary could be used with any other programming language, like Matlab or the-like, without much effort. 


### Installation

Just clone this repo and open it with Unity.


### Agenda

In numeric simulation we operate mostly on mesh-data, so we need easy-to-use but efficient tools for visualization for fast development cycles. The "de-facto-standard" MATLAB covers this with its patch-routine. Here, Unity is used for visualization, which is a great and actively developed platform. Once you've got your data imported into Unity, you can take advantage of a huge community and tons of add-ons for high-quality custom plots. Furthermore Unity runs on various platforms, so, with little effort, you could use your tablet or even mobile phone for displaying the output.
